# gpt - OpenAI API client

OpenAI API client in Bash. Based on the baseless assumption that separating queries in the API call can enhance the AI's ability to distinguish inputs, the application allows appending text queries, files, images, screenshots, and stdin as distinct message modules to the payload. Perform a dry run to inspect the payload as demonstrated in the example below.

```console
$ gpt -d explain the following shell script -f script.sh
Dry-run mode, no API calls made.

        }
      ]
    }
  ]

## Dependencies

* [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)
* [grim](https://git.sr.ht/~emersion/grim) and [slurp](https://github.com/emersion/slurp) for screenshot functionality (Linux Wayland only atm.)
* An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/account-setup)

## Install

```sh
git clone git@github.com:fredrikfoss/gpt-bash.git
cd gpt-bash
make install
```

The program executable will be copied to `~/.local/bin/gpt`. Remember to add directory to path. Example, in `~/.bashrc`:

```sh
export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```

Then, set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable with your API key. Example, in `~/.bashrc`:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-exa****XLJENBTnu
```

If you don't want to make it an environment variable, you could instead store the key in [pass](https://passwordstore.org). Add the key to pass, then in `~/.bashrc` something like:

```sh
alias gpt='OPENAI_API_KEY=$(pass api-keys/openai) gpt'
```

## Usage

```
usage:
    gpt [options] [query]

options:
    -q <query>    add additional query to payload
    -f <file>     add file as additional query
    -i <image>    add PNG or JPEG image file to payload
    -p            add screenshot to payload
    -d            dry-run mode, don't call API
    -h            print help
```

### Examples

```
gpt what is the zig language?
gpt -i path/to/img.png give a filename to this image
gpt compare the two screenshots -p -p
gpt -f file.c add code comments to this program
gpt translate to norwegian -q "to be or not to be?" -q "you shall not pass!"
gpt can the project structure be improved? <<<$(tree -aI .git)
```
